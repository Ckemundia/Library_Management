A library management system that helps librarians manage books through a web app. 
Users (customers) can be able to check what books are available and request the reservation of the book through the platform
The platform comes with a bot(JAMAA BOT), though it's not a complete product as of now; that is supposed to help in book suggestions, study tips, and overall guide the user on how to use the platform
